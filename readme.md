# irclib3

This is a port of the irclib from Python 2. It could definitely benefit from a rewrite, but a port is probably better than nothing.

## Development

It imports! Syntactically, to the interpreter, it looks fine. So far, I've fix the handling and raising of exceptions to be Python 3 compatible. As well as few other small Python 2->3 hiccups. What else works? Who knows, hopefully a things don't take too much effort to patch up. 

## This project sucks!

It sure does! Send some commits this way and lets improve it for everybody. There should be a rewrite of this library, however, no new code exists yet that covers as much as the original irclib.
