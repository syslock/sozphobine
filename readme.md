# irclib3

This is a Python 3 port of the irclib from Python 2. I'm basically trying to save it from a complete rewrite. It's a great learning experience to see the real differences in Python 2.x vs Python 3.x.

## Development

It imports! Syntactically, to the interpreter, it looks fine. So far, I've fix the handling and raising of exceptions to be Python 3 compatible. As well as few other small Python 2->3 hiccups. What else works? Who knows, hopefully a things don't take too much effort to patch up as I hack away at the project. 

## This project sucks!

It sure does! The project's in very early development and it's basically a learning project for me, but in the end I hope to have a beneficial product. Send some commits this way and lets improve it for everybody. There should be a rewrite of this library, however, no new code exists yet that covers as much as the original irclib.
